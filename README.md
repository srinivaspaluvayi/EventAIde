## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srinivaspaluvayi/EventAIde.git
cd EventAIde
```

### 2. Install dependencies

This project uses **Conda** for environment management.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate eventaide
```

*If you use pip, check `environment.yaml` for dependencies and install them manually.*

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
- Add your Ticketmaster API key:

  ```
  TICKETMASTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```

**Notes:**
- It's important to run the initialization notebooks first to ensure all required data/preprocessing is complete before starting the main application.
- If you add new notebooks or change file names, update these steps accordingly.
- Make sure you have working API keys and all dependencies installed per `environment.yaml`.
